# Palm-Pen-Holder
There are multiple sizes available for this device for both the device size and pen hole size. If you are requesting this device, please indicate which size you believe will work the best for you. There is a sizing guide seen below and available for download. **If you want to customize the sizes further download and save both the ".scad" and ".json" files in the same place and use OpenSCAD to edit using the instructions found in the documention folder above**

# Overview
This is a customizable (parametric) 3D printable writing aid. The Palm Pen Holder makes it easier to grip a pen, pencil, or other writing utensil and may be useful for someone who has difficulty holding a pen or pencil directly. The device is able to be slid onto the hand of the user or gripped in various positions. The multiple sizing allows for various writing utensils and hand sizes.
# Usage
A pen or pencil is inserted through the Palm Pen Holder pen hole and is fixed in place by tightening a set screw to allow for different writing utensil sizes. The device can be gripped in multiple ways and also gently squeezes the hand for stability when writing. With different sizing available, this device works well with narrow writing utensils like paintbrushes or wider ones like sharpie markers. In addition, the device itself has alternate sizing to provide options for the user.

# SKILLS REQUIRED

3D Printing

# BILL OF MATERIALS

To assemble the Palm Pen Holder, you will need:

1x 3D Printed Palm Pen Holder

1x M4 machine screws, 20 mm long ($1.25 – $2.50) 

1x M4 hex nuts ($0.25)  

1x Writing utensil (pen, pencil, etc)

# TOOLS

Screwdriver

3D printer

# 3D PRINTING

The design prints in ABS or PLA with no support. 3D print STL’s and instructions can be found on the GitHub page linked at the top of this project page.

# CUSTOMIZATION
The design is parametric, which means that the size of the device itself the size of the pen hole can be modified by changing numbers in OpenSCAD. The editable OpenSCAD file can be found on the GitHub page linked at the top of the project page along with instructions within the documentation.

# Sizing:
There are small, medium, and large-sized Palm Pen Holder available for different hand sizes. In addition, the pen hole diameter can also be changed from narrow, standard, and wide. By use of the set screw, the writing utensil does not need to be the exact size of the pen hole but rather the sizing is available to fit large writing devices like markers and narrow ones such as fine paintbrushes. Sizing Charts can be found below and in addition, downloading the to scale document will allow one to see the outline of the different sizes to determine the ideal size.
